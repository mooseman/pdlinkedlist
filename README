  *** pdlinkedlist ***  

  I've seen lots of versions of linked lists around the place, but 
all of them seemed to have something that made them more 
complex than they should be.  None of them really "hit the spot". 

 Then, I found Adam Hooper's implementation and I knew that 
"this was the one".  Simple, clean, easy to understand.  

  Adam has kindly released the code as "public domain", so 
 "share and enjoy......"  ;)
