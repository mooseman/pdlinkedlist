  I've seen lots of versions of linked lists around the place, but 
all of them seemed to have something that made them more 
complex than they should be.  None of them really "hit the spot". 

 Then, I found Adam Hooper's implementation and I knew that 
I'd found what I was after.  Simple, clean, easy to understand.  

My simple list is largely based on his code, and is "public domain" 
(as his also is).   "Share and enjoy......"  ;)
